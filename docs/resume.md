Professional Projects (Highlights)
--------
#### **CHARGED<sup>3</sup> Hub** [<a href="https://charged3-hub-ifs-mpr.hub.arcgis.com/" target="_blank">https://charged3-hub-ifs-mpr.hub.arcgis.com/</a>]  
CHARGED<sup>3</sup> (Children’s Health & Resource Geographic Exploration for Data-Driven Decisions) is a collaborative project with an interdisciplinary team of GIS and health IT specialists, data scientists, web developers, maternal and child health experts, psychologists, and health services researchers. Funded by The Duke Endowment, the project equips others to identify clusters of health “advantage” and “disadvantage” within South Carolina and, in turn, engages stakeholders to improve children’s lives.

The CHARGED<sup>3</sup> Hub is an online engagement platform for the data-driven CHARGED<sup>3</sup> initiative. It delivers the CHARGED<sup>3</sup> Geospatial Environmental Scan<sup>©</sup> and the underlying framework of the initiative, as well as contextual factors, data, and topics around children Birth to 5.

> **Notable Features:** Allows IFS to leverage existing GIS data and technologies, provides expanded interactivity, dynamic and inter-related mapping and charting, interactive identification of communities and resources, no user download requirements, allows for the linking of additional web applications and products for greater commmunity context, and provides IFS the opportunity for futher updates and scaling of the platform for CHARGED<sup>3</sup> and other project areas. 

> **Notable Challenges:** While every effort has been made to meet 508 compliance, there are some interactive portions of this Hub that do not meet standards. The Institute for Families in Society remains committed to making its web technologies and informational products accessible to all users in accordance to the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, success criteria outlined in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), and known best practices. 

<br/>

#### **CHARGED<sup>3</sup> Geospatial Environmental Scan<sup>©</sup>** [<a href="https://www.schealthviz.sc.edu/charged3" target="_blank">https://www.schealthviz.sc.edu/charged3</a>]
An interactive, embedded PDF product built using desktop GIS software and the Adobe PDF file format to create a data-rich, interactive experience that can be delivered to non-GIS users. Included in the standalone PDF are static maps, an interactive map, linked data tables, metadata, and other visualizations that are combined in a way that tells both a story and allows users to ask data-relevant questions. The CHARGED<sup>3</sup> Geospatial Environmental Scan<sup>©</sup> features data designed to explore gaps in access to health care, continuity of care, and the availability of family support and resource programs for children brith to 5 in South Carolina.

> **Notable Features:** Interactive discovery via an interactive PDF map where users can explore individual data elements of interest by toggling PDF layers on/off.

<br/>

#### **SC Birth Outcomes Initiative Portal** [<a href="https://boi.ifsreports.com/" target="_blank">https://boi.ifsreports.com/</a>]  
The SCBOI interactive dashboard provides users with an instant visual representation of the statewide maternal and birth outcomes metrics – across payment, individual, facility-level, and geographical characteristics. Users can filter, print, and share these data. The dashboard is a tool that facilitates data-driven collaborative decisions to improve the clinical outcomes of mothers and babies in SC.

> **Notable Features:** Play Framework for Java, Dynamic Data Visualization (ChartJS), Responsive and Mobile-First UI (Bootstrap), Database Integration and Management (PostgreSQL, pgAdmin).

> **Notable Challenge(s):** After launch, a portion of the Portal's User-base were not receiving the best user experience, this was because these Users were using older browsers to access the Portal, namely Internet Explorer (IE11). The Portal was developed using modern technologies and code syntax, all of which was not supported by IE11 at the time. For that same User group it was also not feasible for them to upgrade or switch their workstation's and work device's web browsers because of internal and on-site IT policies. To bridge this compatibility gap two development techniques were implemented – code transpiling and polyfilling. The codebase was transpiled into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript and to support JavaScript features that couldn’t be transpiled a polyfill package was created and conditionally loaded only to those browsers that need it so that performance wouldn't be impacted for browsers that did not.
